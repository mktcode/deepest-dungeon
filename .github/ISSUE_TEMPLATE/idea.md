<!--
I use Crypto Workflows to pay rewards! Configure an Ethereum address in your profile repository (github.com/<username>/<username>) by adding a .crypto.json with the following content:

{
  "address": "your ETH address"
}

If I think your idea is cool (1x 👍 + 'cool-idea' label) you will receive 0.01 ETH.
